Source code for various different versions of Tandberg OS, in the form of a GIT history

Reproducability of original binaries have been verified by re-assembling the binaries with https://www.asm80.com/onepage/asm8080.html

One thing to note, the original sources from Tandberg would likely have been split into several parts per program, and linked accordingly. This way, you may have several different releases of the same version of a program, where the only difference is the order of which its parts have been linked.

NOTE: Work in progress
